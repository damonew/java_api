# Java Interview Project Overview

## Purpose

The `java-interview` project is designed to assess a candidate's proficiency in Java and Spring Boot development. It provides a practical coding environment where candidates can demonstrate their skills in building, testing, and maintaining Java applications using industry-standard tools and frameworks.

## What the Project Provides

- **Spring Boot Application Skeleton**: A ready-to-use structure for building RESTful APIs or web applications.
- **Maven Build System**: Standardized dependency management and build lifecycle.
- **Sample Domain Model**: Example entities and repositories to work with.
- **Unit and Integration Test Setup**: Pre-configured testing environment using JUnit and Mockito.
- **API Endpoints**: Example controllers for implementing business logic.
- **Documentation and Instructions**: Guidance for setup, running, and extending the project.

## What the Project Measures

- **Java Fundamentals**: Understanding of core Java concepts (OOP, collections, exceptions, streams).
- **Spring Boot Proficiency**: Ability to use Spring Boot for dependency injection, REST API development, and configuration.
- **Code Quality**: Writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- **Testing Skills**: Implementing unit and integration tests, using mocking frameworks.
- **Problem Solving**: Applying logical thinking to solve real-world scenarios.
- **Maven Usage**: Managing dependencies and build processes.
- **API Design**: Creating RESTful endpoints and handling HTTP requests/responses.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error and exception management.
- **Best Practices**: Following industry standards for Java and Spring development.

## Candidate Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** and set up the project using Maven.
2. **Implement the required features** as described in the assignment.
3. **Write unit and integration tests** to verify your implementation.
4. **Document your code** and decisions where appropriate.
5. **Submit your solution** as instructed.
